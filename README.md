## WinNative: A Community Built Windows Emulation App for Android

**WinNative** is an advanced, high-performance Windows (x86_64) emulation environment for Android. It bridges the gap between desktop gaming and mobile mobility by unifying the best technologies from **Winlator Bionic** and **Pluvia**.

Designed for enthusiasts and power users, WinNative provides a "plug-and-play" experience with a console like interface, deep controller integration, and hardware-specific optimizations for modern Snapdragon devices.
